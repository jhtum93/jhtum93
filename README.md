## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a physicist in the final stages of my doctorate. In the course of my research work, I have built up in-depth expertise in the field of X-ray physics. What I found particularly interesting was the combination of experimental work on spectral clinical CT and the associated challenges in image processing.
